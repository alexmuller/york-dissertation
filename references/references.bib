References must be relevant.
A typical PR3 project report might contain about one page of pertinent references,
if the initial research period was well spent.
Do not include references which you have not read.
If you refer to standard material which is covered by a large number of text-books,
choose one or two really good ones and cite those, rather than a long list of mediocre texts.
