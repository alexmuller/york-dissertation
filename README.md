Hi, my name's Alex Muller.

The project report received a mark of 79%.

## License ##

I don't know who owns this report. It could be me, but it most likely is the
property of the Department of Computer Science at the University of York.
Probably best to not copy it without their permission. Citing it, of course,
is great.

## Availability ##

This report is also available in the
[Department of Computer Science's online library][cslib].

## Project code ##

Unfortunately, I'm not able to make the project code available at this time.
