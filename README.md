# Hi there #

Hi, my name's Alex Muller.

This is my final-year project report for a [BSc in Computer Science with
Maths](http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/undergraduate/ug-courses/cs-maths/) at the
[University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/).

## License ##

I should probably add a license here. For now, the beginning of `Project.tex`
specifies the license as:

> Copyright (c) 2011 Alex Muller. All rights reserved.

Ideally, I'd like to offer it under a more liberal license. Need to talk to my
department about that.

## Project code ##

Ideally, the code for the application discussed in the report will also be
available on GitHub. I need to speak to my department about that too.
