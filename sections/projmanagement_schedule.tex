\subsection{Implementation schedule}

As the time allotted for implementation of the software was limited to under
eight weeks, it was necessary to prioritise certain aspects of the system in
case I was unable to implement every requirement.

Fortunately, the different elements of this project are naturally quite
loosely coupled. I identified the following aspects (ordered by priority):

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Student interface to collect data (27 Feb 2012)
  \item Performing the allocation (5 March 2012)
  \item Staff interface (approx. 16 March 2012)
\end{enumerate}

The staff interface is given as the 16 March as it is not critical for this
pilot. While it would clearly be preferable for staff to set up the system
themselves unaided, it is more important that there is a working student
interface and allocation algorithm.

% • 13 May 2011: first meeting of the Project Steering Group
% • October 2011: research begins
% • January 2012: implementation begins in earnest
% • w/c 27 February 2012: students select their modules
% • w/c 5 March 2012: allocation performed

\subsection{Gantt chart}

A Gantt chart (given in Figure~\ref{ganttchart}) was created to show the
expected progress for the project's implementation. Each of the blocks refers
to week numbers at the University of York, where Autumn week 4 begins on the
31 October 2011, and Spring week 1 on the 9 January 2012.
