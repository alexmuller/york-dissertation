\subsection{Pilot by the Archaeology and History departments}

During the spring term (January to March 2012), the Archaeology and History
departments at the University of York used this application to allocate
modules to their second and third-year students. The application documentation
(Appendix~\ref{sec:documentation}) includes information for departmental
administrators about the setup of the application and limitations they should
be aware of.

A production instance of the application \gls{vm} was provided by
\gls{itservices} from [xx] February. The application was set up by
departmental administrators on [xx] February and the setup was confirmed
during a project group meeting on [xx] February.

As the application was hosted by \gls{itservices} on the \texttt{york.ac.uk}
domain, notification was given to the team that provides end-user support.
Issues are logged by this team from emails to \texttt{itsupport@york.ac.uk},
telephone calls and visits to the IT Support office. During the trial period
issues relating to this application were forwarded to departmental
administrators and the \gls{itservices} developer assisting with the
application.

The application was available to students from 9am on Monday 27 February until
5pm on Monday 5 March.
