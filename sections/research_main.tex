% One or more review chapters, describing the research you did at the
% beginning of the project period.

Web application development is an area of computer science that requires
solving many problems that may only be loosely related. Generally, research
for a typical web application might include the following:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Database structure and underlying software
  \item Programming language
  \item Choice of web framework (if any)
  \item Online security
  \item Front-end, user experience and interaction design
\end{itemize}

However there are two major additional areas that should be researched for
this project, namely issues surrounding the sensitive information that will be
stored by the system and the creation of the allocation once students have
selected their modules, which is a constrained optimisation problem.
