\subsection{Testing}

% Unit tests?

% Performance testing?

% User testing

Prior to the application being made available to students, members of staff
and students were requested to test the application.

% A summary of the feedback is given in Appendix~\ref{sec:testingfeedback}.

The departments provided their finalised course, module and student (making
use of randomly generated ``fake'' usernames) data to the project implementer.
He was then able to perform an allocation based on this data with no rankings
present, to ensure that the allocation algorithm performed as expected.

% The optimisation problem did not cause the solver to report that the model
% was infeasible. If it had done so, an investigation would have had to have
% been carried out to understand which of the constraints was causing the
% solver to fail, and to engage the department to understand why this
% constraint was in place and how it could be modified.
